# Digital Literary Analysis: "Winter Dreams" by F. Scott Fitzgerald

This repository contains materials for a digital literary analysis assignment combining traditional close reading with computational text analysis using Voyant Tools.

## Repository Contents

*   **text.md**: The cleaned, OCR-processed text of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story "Winter Dreams."
*   **analysis.md**: A comprehensive analysis including a close reading and a quantitative exploration with Voyant Tools.
*   **/images/**: A directory containing visualizations exported from Voyant Tools, referenced in the analysis.


## Story Information

*   **Title:** Winter Dreams
*   **Author:** F. Scott Fitzgerald
*   **Source Link:** [Internet Archive](https://ia601307.us.archive.org/11/items/storiesoffscottf030459mbp/storiesoffscottf030459mbp.pdf) 

## Workflow & Methodology

### 1. Text Acquisition and OCR
1.  **Source:** The story was extracted from the scanned PDF of edition available on Internet Archive.
2.  **OCR Process:** The relevant page range was converted to text using **Google Drive's**. The PDF was uploaded to Google Drive and opened with Google Docs, which generated an editable text file.

### 2. Text Cleaning and Preparation
The raw OCR text was manually cleaned in a plain text editor to produce a reliable digital version:
*   **Removed artifacts:** Deleted page numbers, headers, and footnotes from the original scan.
*   **Corrected errors:** Systematically fixed common OCR misreadings using find-and-replace and manual proofreading.

### 3. Analytical Process
The analysis was conducted in two phases:
1.  **Close Reading** A thematic and narrative analysis was performed first, focusing on motifs of the American Dream and character psychology.
2.  **Quantitative (Voyant Tools):** The cleaned **text.md** was uploaded to [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/). Tools like Word cloud) and Trends were used to:
    *   Identify the most frequent terms.
    *   Trace the distribution of key concepts (e.g., *winter*, *summer*, *dream*) across the narrative.
    *   Visualizations were exported as PNG files and saved in the **/images/** folder.

## Key Insights and Reflections

The close reading revealed "Winter Dreams" as a poignant prototype of Fitzgerald's central theme: the corruption of the American Dream. Dexter Green's ambition is fundamentally tied to his idealized, "wintery" illusion of Judy Jones, The seasonal structure (winter-summer-winter) perfectly mirrors this arc of illusion, passion, and disillusionment.

The combination of methods was powerful. The close reading provided depth, nuance, and thematic understanding, while the computational analysis offered verifiable patterns, revealed subtle structural elements.
